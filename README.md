Using the logdna_view resource- a user can create a view with a provided name query, hosts, category, tags, email, pagerduty and webhook channels, delete a view with a given viewid or update a view's properties.

Run go build, terraform init, terraform plan and terraform apply and then navigate to the UI to see your updates!

## Test

In order to run the provider's test suite add your LogDNA servicekey to logdna/provider_test.go and then run the following. Your servicekey can be generated or retrieved from Settings > Organization > API Keys.

```
make test
```

Alternatively, you can run:

```
TF_ACC=1 go test ./logdna -v
```

# LogDNA Provider

ðŸš§ In public beta ðŸš§

[LogDNA](https://logdna.com) is a centralized log management platform. The LogDNA Provider allows organizations to manage Views and Alerts programmatically via Terraform.

## Example Usage

```hcl 
# Configure the LogDNA Provider
provider "logdna" {
  servicekey = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  url = "https://api.logdna.com" # (Optional) LogDNA Region Instance, needed for IBM-based instances
}

resource "logdna_view" "http500" {
 name     = "HTTP 500s"
 query    = "request:500"
 email_channel {
    emails          = ["test@logdna.com"]  # Email address to send alerts to
    operator        = "presence"           # Trigger on the presence of lines
    terminal        = "true"               # Alert at the end of the trigger interval
    triggerinterval = "15m"                # Time window for alert (15 minutes)
    triggerlimit    = 15                   # Lines threshold for alert (15 lines)
 }
}
```

## Pre-requirements and considerations
Before using Terraform for creating resources in LogDNA, review the following notes:
- Verify Terraform is [installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli). The minimum supported version is 0.12.0 and can be checked by running `terraform version`
- Have the service key for your Organization available. To obtain the service key for your LogDNA Organization, go to the LogDNA dashboard and navigate to **Settings > Organization > API Keys** or follow this link [here](https://app.logdna.com/manage/api-keys)
- Be aware that the underlying LogDNA Configuration API has a rate limit of 50 requests at a time; therefore, when using the LogDNA Terraform provider, there is also a limit of 50 resource operations at a time
- If you do not provide a specific base URL in the provider configuration, the base url defaults to `https://api.logdna.com`
- Authentication is handled via the `servicekey` parameter and can be set in the provider configuration

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `servicekey`: _(Required)_ LogDNA Account Service Key. This can be generated or retrieved from Settings > Organization > API Keys. Type _string_
- `url`: _(Optional)_ The LogDNA region URL. If youâ€™re configuring an IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA or IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA youâ€™ll need to ensure `url` is set to the [right endpoint depending on the IBM region](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA-endpoints#endpoints_api). Type _string_ (**_Default: api.logdna.com_**)
